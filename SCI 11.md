# Module 5 Population Dynamics
### Population
- an interbreeding group of individuals of a single
species that occupy the same general area
## Community
- the assemblage of interacting populations that
inhabit the same area. 
## Ecosystem
- comprised of 1 or more communities and the abiotic
environment within an area.
## Density 
- number of individuals per unit area
## Dispersion
- pattern of spacing among individuals within the geographic boundaries

### Examples of Patterns of Population
1. Clumped
2. Random
3. Uniform

## Population Dynamics
- The size of a population is determined by a balance betweenbirths, immigration, deaths and
emigration

### Age Structure
- the proportion of individuals in each age
class of a population

### Types of Population Dynamics
1. Type 1 - High Survivorship (Mammals)
2. Type 2 - Medium Survivorship (Birds)
3. Type 3 - Low Survivorship (Reptiles, plants)

### Characteristics of Population Dynamics
1. Size
2. Density
3. Dispersal
4. Immigration 
5. Emigration
6. Births 
7. Deaths 
8. Survivorship

### Semelparity
- Big-bang production where large number of offspring are produced in each reproduction, after0 which the individual often dies

### Iteroparity
- Some organisms produce only a few eggs/offspring during repeated reproductive episodes.

### Population Growth
1. Exponential (unresticted) growth
    - The growth rate of the population accelerates.
2. Logistic (restricted) growth
    - There exists a <strong>point</strong> of maximum growth and a <strong>carrying capacity</strong> where growth rate slows down 
    - Some of the assumptions
built into the logistic model
do not apply to all
populations.

### Selection of Population
- Resource availability depends on the situation
- The life history traits that natural
selection favors may vary with
population density and environmental
conditions.
- In K-selection, organisms live
and reproduce around K, and are
sensitive to population density. 
- In r-selection, organisms exhibit
high rates of reproduction and
occur in variable environments
in which population densities
fluctuate well below K.

|  | r-selection | k-selection |
| --- | ----------- | --------- |
| Climate | Variable and Unpredictable | Constant and Predictable |
| Mortality | Density-Independent | Density Dependent |
| Survivorship | Large Juvenile Mortality | Constant or Large Adult Mortality |
| Population Size | Variable and well below carrying capacity | Constant and at carrying capacity |
| Competition | Weak | Strong |
| Selection for | Early Reproduction, small body size, semelparity | Delayed Reproduction, Large Body Size, Iteroparity |
| Lifespan | Short (<1 year) | Long (>1 year) |

### Population Regulation
- Nature Population size and growth are limited by factors
- Some are density-dependent while others are density-independent
- Density-Independent Factors
    - Severe storms and flooding
    - suddent unpredictable severe cold spells
    - earthquakes and volcanoes
    - catasprophic meteorite impacts
- Density-denependent factors
    - <Strong>Extrinsic</Strong> Biotic
        - Limiting resources
        - infectious disease 
        - predation
        - waste
    - <Strong>Intrinsic</Strong> Biotic
        - Stress
        - Territoriality
        - Dispersal
