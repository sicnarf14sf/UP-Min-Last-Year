# Module 5 Population Dynamics

## Population

- an interbreeding group of individuals of a single
  species that occupy the same general area

## Community

- the assemblage of interacting populations that
  inhabit the same area.

## Ecosystem

- comprised of 1 or more communities and the abiotic
  environment within an area.

## Density

- number of individuals per unit area

## Dispersion

- pattern of spacing among individuals within the geographic boundaries

### Examples of Patterns of Population

1. Clumped
2. Random
3. Uniform

## Population Dynamics

- The size of a population is determined by a balance betweenbirths, immigration, deaths and
  emigration

### Age Structure

- the proportion of individuals in each age
  class of a population

### Types of Population Dynamics

1. Type 1 - High Survivorship (Mammals)
2. Type 2 - Medium Survivorship (Birds)
3. Type 3 - Low Survivorship (Reptiles, plants)

### Characteristics of Population Dynamics

1. Size
2. Density
3. Dispersal
4. Immigration
5. Emigration
6. Births
7. Deaths
8. Survivorship

### Semelparity

- Big-bang production where large number of offspring are produced in each reproduction, after0 which the individual often dies

### Iteroparity

- Some organisms produce only a few eggs/offspring during repeated reproductive episodes.

### Population Growth

1. Exponential (unresticted) growth
   - The growth rate of the population accelerates.
2. Logistic (restricted) growth - There exists a <strong>point</strong> of maximum growth and a <strong>carrying capacity</strong> where growth rate slows down - Some of the assumptions
   built into the logistic model
   do not apply to all
   populations.

### Selection of Population

- Resource availability depends on the situation
- The life history traits that natural
  selection favors may vary with
  population density and environmental
  conditions.
- In K-selection, organisms live
  and reproduce around K, and are
  sensitive to population density.
- In r-selection, organisms exhibit
  high rates of reproduction and
  occur in variable environments
  in which population densities
  fluctuate well below K.

|                 | r-selection                                      | k-selection                                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Climate         | Variable and Unpredictable                       | Constant and Predictable                           |
| Mortality       | Density-Independent                              | Density Dependent                                  |
| Survivorship    | Large Juvenile Mortality                         | Constant or Large Adult Mortality                  |
| Population Size | Variable and well below carrying capacity        | Constant and at carrying capacity                  |
| Competition     | Weak                                             | Strong                                             |
| Selection for   | Early Reproduction, small body size, semelparity | Delayed Reproduction, Large Body Size, Iteroparity |
| Lifespan        | Short (<1 year)                                  | Long (>1 year)                                     |

### Population Regulation

- Nature Population size and growth are limited by factors
- Some are density-dependent while others are density-independent
- Density-Independent Factors
  - Severe storms and flooding
  - suddent unpredictable severe cold spells
  - earthquakes and volcanoes
  - catasprophic meteorite impacts
- Density-denependent factors
  - <Strong>Extrinsic</Strong> Biotic
    - Limiting resources
    - infectious disease
    - predation
    - waste
  - <Strong>Intrinsic</Strong> Biotic
    - Stress
    - Territoriality
    - Dispersal

# Module 6 Changes in Populations Over Time

| Genetic Event                             | Outcome                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mutation                                  | Source of New Alleles                                   |
| Crossing Over                             | Introduces new combinations of alleles into chromosomes |
| Independent Assortment                    | Mixes maternal and paternal chromosomes                 |
| Fertilization                             | Combines alleles from two parents                       |
| Changes in chromosome number or structure | Transposition, duplication, or loss of chromosomes      |

- Individuals of a population share morphological, physiological, and
  behavioral traits with a heritable basis

- Variations within a population arise from different alleles of shared
  genes

- Traits that vary continuously often arise by interactions among alleles
  of several genes, and may be influenced by environmental factors

- <strong>Genes</strong> control characters, determines the
  characteristics of a person.
- <strong>Genes</strong> are passed on from parents to
  offspring, <strong>NOT CHARACTERS</strong>.

### Allele

- one of the two alternative states of a gene

#### Dominant allele

- an allele of a gene that is expressed and mask the
  effect of the other.

#### Recessive allele

- allele of a gene whose effects is masked by the presence of a dominant allele.

#### Genotype

- The genetic make-up of an individual
- TT, Tt, tt

#### Phenotype

- Expressed, Physical Traits
- The visible appearance of an individual

### Gene Pool

- The sum total of genes of all
  individuals of a genetic
  population constitute the
  gene pool
- It tells us not only the
  number and kinds of genes
  but also the way it is
  distributed among the
  individuals in a population

### Allelic Frequency

- is the relative frequency of an allele in a population

#### Genotypic Frequency

- proportion of genotype in a population

- is the number of individuals with a given genotype divided by the total
  number of individuals in the population

#### Phenotypic Frequency

- is how often a particular phenotype occurs in a population
- is the number of individuals in a population that have a specific observable
  trait

### Computing Allelic Frequency

- A = [(number of HOMOZYGOUS dominant alleles * 2 + number of HETEROZYGOUS allele)] / (1000 \* 2)
- a = 1 - A

### Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium

- the hereditary process alone does not produce evolutionary change.
  - Allelic frequency will remain constant generation to generation unless disturbed by mutation, natural selection, migration, nonrandom mating, or genetic drift.
- Developed by Godfrey Hardy and Wilhelm Weinberg in 1908

#### Hardy-Weinberg Equation

- P^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1
- p = freq of A
- q = freq of a
- p2 = freq of AA
- q2 = freq of aa
- 2pq = freq of Aa

## Factors that Change Population Over Time

- Five theoretical conditions of genetic equilibrium:

1. Mutations never occur
2. Population is infinitely large
3. Population is isolated from all other populations of the
   species (no gene flow)
4. Mating is random
5. All individuals survive and produce the same number of
   offspring

### <strong>Mutation</strong>

- Mutations are the original source of new alleles; many are
  lethal or neutral mutations

#### lethal mutation

- Mutation that drastically alters phenotype
- Causes death

#### neutral mutation

- A mutation that has no effect on survival or reproduction

#### Adaptive mutation

- Occasionally, a change in the environment favors a mutation
  that had previously been neutral or even somewhat harmful

- Through natural selection, a beneficial mutation tends to
  increase in frequency in a population over generations

- Mutations are the source of Earthâ€™s staggering biodiversity

### <strong>Genetic Drift</strong>

- Random change in allele frequencies, or genetic
  drift, can lead to loss of genetic diversity by
  causing alleles to become fixed, especially in
  small populations

- genetic drift - Change in allele frequencies in a population
  due to chance alone

- fixed - Refers to an allele for which all members of a
  population are homozygous

- The larger the population, the smaller the impact of random
  changes in allele frequencies

#### Bottlenecks

- Drastic reduction in population size so severe that it
  reduces genetic diversity

#### Founder Effect

- Change in allele frequencies that occurs when a small number of individuals establish a new population

### <strong>Gene Flow</strong>

- The movement of alleles into and out of a population
- e.g. Blue jays move acorns, and their alleles, among populations
  of oak trees that would otherwise be genetically isolated

### Inbreeding

- Non-random mating among close relatives

#### Founder Effect and Inbreeding

- Ellis-van Creveld syndrome:
  - characterized by dwarfism, polydactyly, and heart defects

### Natural Selection

- Process in which environmental pressures result in differential survival and reproduction of individuals of a population who vary in details of shared, heritable traits
- is the only one of these ways of altering the gene pool that results in adaptation

### Evolution in Other Systems

- Evolution in cultural and social systems.

# Module 8 Biodiversity

## Biodiversity

- Coined by Walter Rozen of the National Research Council/National Academy of Sciences (NRC/NAS 1985)
- <strong>Total richness</strong> and <strong>Variety</strong> of life on earth
- <strong>Variability</strong> among living systems from the land, the seas, and other aquatic ecosystems, and the ecological complexes of which they are part (CBD)

| Levels of Biodiversity |
| ---------------------- |
| Genetic Diversity      |
| Species Diversity      |
| Ecosystem Diversity    |

### Genetic Diversity

- Sum total of information contained in the genes of species of plants, animals, and microorganisms

### Species Diversity

- Variety of species, including their <strong>abundance</strong>, <strong>distribution</strong> and <strong> functions or interactions </strong> within a given spatial context, which can be a geographical region/location/ecosystem

### 2 measurements

#### Richness

- Is a measure of the <strong>number of different kinds of organisms </strong> present in a particular area regardless of scale.

#### Evenness

- Compares the similarity of the <strong> population size </strong> of each of the species present.

### Ecosystem Diversity

- Distribution and abundance of habits, biotic communities, and ecological processes in the biosphere.

## BIODIVERSITY ATTRIBUTES AND ECOSYSTEMS PROCESSES

### Composition

- describes the parts of each biodiversity component in that area
  - habitat types
  - species present
  - genetic diversity within species

### Structure

- Refers to the physical characteristics supporting that composition
  - size of habitats
  - forest canopy structure

### Function

- Variety of biological processes, functions or characteristics of a particular ecosystem/area.
  - pollination
  - natural disturbances
  - predator-prey relationships

## LEVELS OF BIODIVERSITY

- Biodiversity at all forms, levels, structure, and function provides many <strong>anthropocentric</strong>, as well as, <strong>ecocentric</strong> benefits to humandkind.

## MEASURING AND MONITORING BIODIVERSITY USING SURROGATE SPECIES

### Surrogate Species

- simpler and quicker approach to measure and monitor biodiversity
- can represent a broader set of species and/or habitats to support conservation or management strategies
- some conservation shortcuts/surrogate species are:
  - keystone species
  - umbrella species
  - indicator species
  - flagship species

### Keystone Species

- Exert <strong>strong control</strong> on community structure not by numerical might but by their pivotal ecological roles or niches
- Their impact becomes apparent once they are <strong>removed</strong> from an ecosystem

### Umbrella Species

- Require such large areas of habitat that their protection might automatically protect a large number of naturally-occurring species in several ecosystems and habitats

### Indicator Species

- are species that set a benchmark against which comparisons can be made after a period of time whether conservation interventions are applied or not.
- are <strong>sensitive to certain changes in the environmental factors</strong> hence are only found in environments where these factors are optimal.

### Flagship Species

- Are popular, charismatic species that serve as symbols and rallying points to stimulate conservation awareness and action.
- They serve to act as an ambassador, icon or symbol for a defined habitat, issue, campaign or environmental cause.

## BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS

- A place on Earth that is both <strong>biologically rich and deeply threatened</strong> due to habitat loss by human activity.

1. Palearctic
2. Nearctic
3. Oceanic
4. Neotropical
5. Afrotropical
6. Indo-Malay
7. Australasian
8. Antarctic

### 2 Distinct Criteria:

1. It must have a <strong>high percentage of plant life</strong> found nowhere else in the world which amounts to at least 1,500 endemic vascular plants (less than 0.5% of the world's total).
2. It must have <strong>30%</strong> or less of its originalk natural vegetation.

### Endemism

- a gene, species, or an ecosystem is only found or only lives in a particular region of the world, hence the loss of its kind means that it is lost forever.

### Ecoregion

- Complex pattern of biodiversity distribution
- Determined by <strong>climate, geology and the evolutionary history of the planet.</strong>
- Large unit of land or water containing a geographically distinct assemblage of species, natural communities, and environmental conditions

### International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List

2. Extinct in the Wild (EW)
3. Critically Endangered (CR)
4. Endangered (EN)
5. Vulnerable (VU)
6. Near Threatened (NT)
7. Least Concern (LC)
8. Data Deficient (DD)
9. Not Evaluated (NE)

- The <strong>Philippines</strong> is one of the 17 mega-diverse countries in the world but is also considered as <strong>biodiversity hotspot</strong>

### Biodiversity Loss

- Local Scenario: Reduction of species richness and the decline in abundance of individuals of a species
- Greater Scale: Extinction of Species
- Causes significant harm to human well-being

### Cause of Biodversity Loss

  - Appendix 3
    - Includes all species which any party identifies as being subject to regulation within its jurisdiction for the purpose of preventing or restricting exploitation, and as needing the cooperation of other parties in the control of trade

### IUCN Categories of Threats

- Extinct in the wild (EW)
  - a taxon when it is only known to survive in cultivation, captivity, or as a naturalized population (or populations) well outside the past range.
- Critically Endangered (CR)
  - a taxon when it is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild in the immediate future, as defined in any criteria (Rapid decline, Small range, Small population).
