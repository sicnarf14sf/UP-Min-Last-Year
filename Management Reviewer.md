# CHAPTER 1

## Principles of Management (Session 1)

* Management is both an **ART** & **SCIENCE**
    * Management is both an art and a science. It is a science because it relies on established principles, data, and systematic approaches to problem-solving. It is an art because it requires creativity, intuition, and the ability to navigate human dynamics, which are often unpredictable and unique to each situation. Balancing these elements is key to effective management.

* Management
    * "The art of getting things done through the efforts of other people."

* Principles of Management
    * The means by which you actually manage - get things done through others - individually , in groups, or in organizations.

* Types of Managers:
    * Top Managers
        * Responsible for **developing the organization's strategy** and **being a steward for its vision and mission.**
    * Functional Managers
        * Responsible for developing the **effeciency** and **effectiveness** of an area, such as accounting or marketing.
    * Supervisory of Team Managers
        * Responsible for coordinating a subgroup of a particular function or a team composed of members from different parts of the organization:
           * **Line Managers** - Leads a function that contributes directly to the products or services the organization creates.
           * **Staff Managers** - Leads a function that contributes indirect inputs.

## Characteristics and Roles of a Manager (Session 2)
| Heirarchy of Management  |   Diffferences in Skill Levels  | 
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| Executive Management  | More Conceptual, A bit of human, and less technical  |
| Middle Management  | A bit Conceptual, A bit of human, and A bit technical  |
| First-line Management  | less Conceptual, more human, and more technical  |
| Rank-and-file Employees  |

## The changing roles of management and managers

* <strong>Empowerment</strong> is the process of enabling or authorizing an individual to think, behave, take action, and control work and decision making in autonomous ways.

#### Traditional Roles of Management
* Top Managers ensure the organization's comptetitiveness and lower level managers' and employees' job security.
* Lower-level managers and employees implement top management's strategy with loyalty and obedience.

#### Contemporary Roles of Management

# CHAPTER 2

## Managerial Decision-making (Session 3)

* <strong>Decision-making</strong> is the action or process of thinking through possible options and selecting one.
    * managers are continually making decisions.
    * the quality of decision-making has an impact of organization and its stakeholders.

### Deciding when to decide

#### Manager's decisions are often complex ones -involve a range of options and uncertain outcomes.
* How much information is needed to make a good decision?
* When to make a decision?
   * Failing to react quickly enough can lead to missed opportunities
   * Acting too quickly can lead to organizational resources being poorly allocated
   * Fragile Egos

#### Effective managers recognize that given the complexity of many tasks, some failures are inevitable.

#### What is the right answer?
* Decision making â‰  Multiple-choice test
* it is a choice between:
     * Multiple good options, and that's not clear which will be the best.
     * Multiple bad options, and the task is to minimize them.
* Manager must make decisions knowing that someone will be upset no matter what decision is reached.

#### What is the ethical answer?
* Decisions are made that go beyond just upsetting someone - managers make decision in which  harm could be cause to others.
* Ethics and morals refer to our beliefs about what is right vs. wrong, good vs. evil, virtuous vs. corrupt.
* It is therefore important to be mindful about whether our decisions have a positive or a negative impact.

## Barriers to effective Decision-making (Session 4)

* The human brain processes information for decision-making using on of two routes:
   * reflective system - logical, analytical, deliberate, and methodical
   * reactive system - quick, impulsive, and intuitive, relying on emotions or habits to provide cues for what to do next.


#### The role of emotions

* <Strong>Emotional Intelligence</Strong> is the ability to recognize, understand, pay attention to, and manage one's own emotions and the emotions of  others.
* <Strong>Programmed Decisions</Strong> are those that are repeated over time and for which an existing set of rules can be developed to guide the process.
* <Strong>Non-Programmed Decisions</Strong> are novel, unstructured decisions that are generally based on criteria that are not well-defined.
   * <strong>Nonroutine decisions</strong> or as <strong>high-involvement</strong> decisions because they require greater involvement and thought on the part of the decision maker
   * There present the greater challenge

#### Barriers to Effective Decision-Making

* <Strong>Bounded Rationality</Strong>
   * Our brains have limitations in terms of the amount of information they can process
* <Strong>Escalation of Commitment</Strong>
   * Once we commit to a decision, we may find it difficult to reevaluate that decision rationally.
* <Strong>Time Constraints</Strong>
   * Time pressures can cause us to rely on heuristics rather than engage in deep processing.
* <Strong>Uncertainty</Strong>
   * Commiting to one option means forgoing other options.
* <Strong>Personal Biases</Strong>
   * Confirmation bias.
* <Strong>Conflict</Strong>
   * Process conflict.
   * Relationship conflict.
