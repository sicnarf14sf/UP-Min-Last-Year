# CHAPTER 1 Managing and Performing

## Principles of Management (Session 1)

- Management is both an **ART** & **SCIENCE**

  - Management is both an art and a science. It is a science because it relies on established principles, data, and systematic approaches to problem-solving. It is an art because it requires creativity, intuition, and the ability to navigate human dynamics, which are often unpredictable and unique to each situation. Balancing these elements is key to effective management.

- Management

  - "The art of getting things done through the efforts of other people."

- Principles of Managementa

  - The means by which you actually manage - get things done through others - individually , in groups, or in organizations.

- Types of Managers:
  - Top Managers
    - Responsible for **developing the organization's strategy** and **being a steward for its vision and mission.**
  - Functional Managers
    - Responsible for developing the **effeciency** and **effectiveness** of an area, such as accounting or marketing.
  - Supervisory of Team Managers
    - Responsible for coordinating a subgroup of a particular function or a team composed of members from different parts of the organization:
      - **Line Managers** - Leads a function that contributes directly to the products or services the organization creates.
      - **Staff Managers** - Leads a function that contributes indirect inputs.

## Characteristics and Roles of a Manager (Session 2)

| Heirarchy of Management | Diffferences in Skill Levels                          |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Executive Management    | More Conceptual, A bit of human, and less technical   |
| Middle Management       | A bit Conceptual, A bit of human, and A bit technical |
| First-line Management   | less Conceptual, more human, and more technical       |
| Rank-and-file Employees |

## The changing roles of management and managers

- <strong>Empowerment</strong> is the process of enabling or authorizing an individual to think, behave, take action, and control work and decision making in autonomous ways.

#### Traditional Roles of Management

- Top Managers ensure the organization's comptetitiveness and lower level managers' and employees' job security.
- Lower-level managers and employees implement top management's strategy with loyalty and obedience.

#### Contemporary Roles of Management

- Empowered lower-level managers and employees are responsible for the organization's comptetiveness and their own development.
- Top management support personal development and ensure employability.

## Henry Mintzberg's managerial roles

| Role          | Tasks                                                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Interpersonal | Figurehead, Leader, Liaison                                       |
| Informational | Monitor, Disseminator, Spokesperson                               |
| Decisional    | Entrepreneur, Disturbance Handler, Resource Allocator, Negotiator |

- **Interpersonal**

  - <strong>Figurehead</strong> - Perform formal duties like greeting visitors and signing contracts and other legal documents
  - <strong>Leader</strong> - Motivate, train, counsel, communicate, and direct subordinates.
  - <strong>Liaison</strong> - Maintain and manage information links inside and outside the organization.

- **Informational**

  - <strong>Monitor</strong> - Seek and receive information from a variety of sources (web, industry journals, reports, and contracts)
  - <strong>Disseminator</strong> - Pass information on to others in the organiuzation through memos, emails, phone calls, etc.
  - <strong>Spokespearson</strong> - Transmit information to people outside the organization through speeches, interviews, and written communication.

- **Decisional**
  - <strong>Entrepreneur</strong> - Initiate projects that lead to improvements; delegate idea-generation responsibilities to others and identify best ideas to act on.
  - <strong>Disturbance Handler</strong> - Take corrective action during conflicts and crises; resolve disputes among subordinates.
  - <strong>Resource Allocator</strong> - Decide who receives resources, manage schedules and budgets, and set priorities.
  - <strong>Negotiator</strong> - Represent a team, department, or organization regarding contracts, union negotiations, etc.

# CHAPTER 2 Managerial Decision-making

## Managerial Decision-making (Session 3)

- <strong>Decision-making</strong> is the action or process of thinking through possible options and selecting one.
  - managers are continually making decisions.
  - the quality of decision-making has an impact of organization and its stakeholders.

### Deciding when to decide

#### Manager's decisions are often complex ones -involve a range of options and uncertain outcomes.

- How much information is needed to make a good decision?
- When to make a decision?
  - Failing to react quickly enough can lead to missed opportunities
  - Acting too quickly can lead to organizational resources being poorly allocated
  - Fragile Egos

#### Effective managers recognize that given the complexity of many tasks, some failures are inevitable.

#### What is the right answer?

- Decision making â‰  Multiple-choice test
- it is a choice between:
  - Multiple good options, and that's not clear which will be the best.
  - Multiple bad options, and the task is to minimize them.
- Manager must make decisions knowing that someone will be upset no matter what decision is reached.

#### What is the ethical answer?

- Decisions are made that go beyond just upsetting someone - managers make decision in which harm could be cause to others.
- Ethics and morals refer to our beliefs about what is right vs. wrong, good vs. evil, virtuous vs. corrupt.
- It is therefore important to be mindful about whether our decisions have a positive or a negative impact.

## Barriers to effective Decision-making (Session 4)

- The human brain processes information for decision-making using on of two routes:
  - reflective system - logical, analytical, deliberate, and methodical
  - reactive system - quick, impulsive, and intuitive, relying on emotions or habits to provide cues for what to do next.

#### The role of emotions

- <Strong>Emotional Intelligence</Strong> is the ability to recognize, understand, pay attention to, and manage one's own emotions and the emotions of others.
- <Strong>Programmed Decisions</Strong> are those that are repeated over time and for which an existing set of rules can be developed to guide the process.
- <Strong>Non-Programmed Decisions</Strong> are novel, unstructured decisions that are generally based on criteria that are not well-defined.
  - <strong>Nonroutine decisions</strong> or as <strong>high-involvement</strong> decisions because they require greater involvement and thought on the part of the decision maker
  - There present the greater challenge

#### Barriers to Effective Decision-Making

- <Strong>Bounded Rationality</Strong>
  - Our brains have limitations in terms of the amount of information they can process
- <Strong>Escalation of Commitment</Strong>
  - Once we commit to a decision, we may find it difficult to reevaluate that decision rationally.
- <Strong>Time Constraints</Strong>
  - Time pressures can cause us to rely on heuristics rather than engage in deep processing.
- <Strong>Uncertainty</Strong>
  - Commiting to one option means forgoing other options.
- <Strong>Personal Biases</Strong>
  - Confirmation bias.
- <Strong>Conflict</Strong>
  - Process conflict.
  - Relationship conflict.

## Decision-making & Case analysis (Session 5)

### Techniques for Making Better Programmed Decisions

- Challenge: To minimize the time spent making decisions on issues that are not particularly important but must still be addressed:
  - Heuristics
  - Satisficing
- A systematic process can be applied in decision-making.
- Quality of the decision is more critical than the time spent on the decision
  1. Recognize that a decision needs to be made.
  2. Generate multiple alternatives.
  3. Analyze the alternatives
  4. Select an alternative.
  5. Implement the selected alternative.
  6. Evaluate its effectiveness.

### Group Decision-making

#### Advantages

- <strong>Brainstorming</strong> is a process of generating as many solutions or options as possible and is a popular technique associated with group decision-making.

#### Disadvantages

- <strong>Groupthink</strong> occurs when group members choose not to voice their concerns or objections because they would rather keep the peace and not annoy or antagonize others.

#### Improve Group Decision-making

| Type of Decision | Technique                                     | Benefit                                                                   |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Group Decisions  | Have diverse members in the group             | Improves quality: generates more options, reduces bias                    |
|                  | Assign a devil's advocate                     | Improves quality: reduces groupthink                                      |
|                  | Encourage everyone to speak up and contribute | Improves quality: generates more options, prevents suppression of dissent |
|                  | Help group members find common ground         | Improves quality: reduces personal conflict                               |

- Steps in conducting a case study:
  1. Identify the problem or issue.
  2. Jot down the objectives you want to focus on.
  3. Decide on whose point of view are you taking.
  4. Enumerate the limitations of the case topic.
  5. List the alternative courses of action.
  6. Evaluate each of the alternatives and options (pros & cons)
  7. Recommend what option to take - suggest a plan
  8. Identify contingencies

# CHAPTER 3 History of Management

## History of Management (Session 6)

#### Management in the Ancient World

| Early Contributor | Outcome                                              |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| Sumerians         | Writing & Trade                                      |
| Hammurabi         | Written commands and control                         |
| Nebuchadnezzer    | Incentives                                           |
| Ancient Egyptians | Division of Labor, coordination and span of control  |
| Sun Tzu           | Division of Labor, communication and coordination    |
| Han Dynasty       | Bureaucracy                                          |
| Ancient Greeks    | Divison of Labor                                     |
| Romans            | Standardization                                      |
| Italians          | Accounting, Corporations, Multinational Corporations |
| John Florio       | Management to English Language                       |

- <strong>Italian Rennaisance</strong>

  - Reintroduction of classical knowledge and the emergence of new knowledge and new learning, much of which had economic and business implications in Northen Italy.
  - Saw the rise of complex organization which required more systematic practices.s
  - It laid its contributions to modern management with the rise of management knowledge brought about by the blooming of multiple organizations which required management. In addition to this, several principles and strategies were also introduced.

- <strong>Industrial Revolution</strong>
  - The rennaisance and its ideals reached England where the word "Management" came into the english language from Italy.
  - The marketplace was established which was organized for the exchange of goods.
- <strong>Adam Smith</strong>
  - Father of Economics
  - Proposed the Idea of Specialization and Coordination within corporations.
- <strong>Divison of Labor</strong>
  - Breaking down a process into subprocessses which will be performed by a specialized worker. Together, these subtasks would produce the final product.
- <strong>Specialization</strong>
  - The training of a worker on a portion of the whole process of the creation of a product.

During this time, the development of the <ins>steam engine</ins> played a major role in improving the transportation of goods
and raw materials.

The concept of standardization was also introduced.

Factories upscaled from sections of cities to whole cities. Small factories turned into larger ones.

The revolutions shifted from England and eventually reached the United States.

- Transportation
- Telegraph: Information Sharing
- <strong>Market Revolution</strong> which spawned a wide variety of corporations that needed managers to coordinate various company offices.
-

After the civil war, gigantic corporations emerged and several problems arose during this time:

1.  "How are workers motivated?"
    - Factory workers could avoid work or even destroy machines if they disliked management ideas.
2.  Production quantity was Unknown

    - Workers feared losing jobs if they produced too much of the products which resulted to the punishment of workers who produced too much - <strong>Soldiering</strong>.

#### Frederick Winslow Taylor

- Father of Scientific Management
- Proposed the <strong>four (4) principles of management</strong> - <Strong>Taylorism</Strong>
  - <strong>Principle 1</strong> - A manager should develop a rule of science for each aspect of a job.
  - <strong>Princple 2</strong> - Scientifically select and train each worker.
  - <strong>Principle 3</strong> - Management and the workforce should work together to ensure that work is performed according to the principles of management.
  - <strong>Principle 4</strong> - Work and Responsibility should be equally divided between management and workers.

### Taylor's Acolytes

- Carl G. Barth

  - Mathematician
  - Aided in the study of employee fatigue and developed the slide rule

- Henry Gantt

  - Gantt Chart
  - Employee bonus system

- Frank and Lillian Gilbreth
  - Motion studies
  - No smoking on the job.

Taylor's Shortcomings

- Attracted more enemies than followers
- Ignored strategy and implementation and thought of workers as machine tools to be used rather than as human beings.

### Administrative and Bureaucratic Management

#### Henry Fayol (1841-1925)

- Focused on Top managers who set strategy
- Unlike Taylor, Fayol focused more on overall management of the corporation rather than on individual tasks.
- Stressed for the need for <strong>"Unity of Command"</strong>
- Fayol's notable contributions:
  - Unity of command:
    - Unity of command means that each employee should receive orders from and report to only one direct supervisor, ensuring clear authority and responsibility, and avoiding confusion and conflicting instructions.
  - Esprit de Corps
    - cohesion of workers in a given unit or department, to their commitment to their individual goals and to their co-workers
  - Justice
    - an organizattion must decide issues fairly and equitably
- Fayolism
  - 14 principles of management
    1. Division of work
    2. Authority
    3. Discipline
    4. Unity of Command
    5. Unity of direction
    6. Subordination of individual interests
    7. Remuneration
    8. Centralization
    9. Scalar chain
    10. Order
    11. Equity
    12. Stability of Tenure of Personnel
    13. Initiative
    14. Esprit de corps

##### Five (5) functions of management

1. Planning
2. Organizing
3. Staffing
4. Controlling
5. Directing

#### Max Weber

- German sociologist who made significant complementary contributions to Taylor's management system as well as to the disciplines of economics and sociology.
- Father of Sociology
- Weber identified the three (3) types of leadership:
  - Charismatic Domination (familial and religious)
  - Traditional Domination (patriarchs, patrimonalism, and feudalism)
  - Legal Domination (modern law, state, and bureaucracy)
- His contribution to management is the development and understanding of the legal rationalism model of leadership, which stressed the idea that leaders should make decisions based on law, precedent, and rule, rather than whim.
- His most notable contribution to modern management is the creation of the <strong>modern bureaucracy</strong>.
- Principles of the Ideal Bureaucracy:
  - Specialized Roles
  - Recruitment based on merit
  - Uniform principles of placement, promotion, and transfer
  - Careerism with systematic salary structure
  - Heirarchy, Responsibility, and Accountability
  - Subjection of official conduct to strict rules of discipline and control
  - Supremacy of abstract rules
  - Impersonal authority (i.e. office bearer does not bring the office with him)

#### Human Relations Movement

### Elton Mayo

- His vision on the Hawthorne studies dominated the literature on human relations theory.
- Worker productivity is increased when they received attention, highlighting the importance of social factors in the workplace.
- "Hawthorne effect", where individuals modify their behavior when they know they are being observed.
- Observed that production could be increased if management understood the role of individual workers' attitudes towards work and also took into account how group attitudes affected behavior.

### Human relations theory

- Recognized that social factors were a source of power in the workplace.

### Barnard and the "zone of indifference"

- <strong>Chester Barnard</strong>
  - His notable contribution was a book called The functions of the Executive
  - Organization as a Cooperative System: Barnard saw organizations as systems of cooperation and communication.
  - The main idea behind the <strong>Zone of Indifference</strong> is that workers will comply with orders if they are indifferent to them which suggests that workers need merely to be indifferent to an order to follow it and that workers will follow orders due to an individual's natural tendency to follow authority.
  - The <strong>Zone of Indifference</strong> must be reached through the following factors:
    1. workers must have the ability to comply with the order.
    2. workers must understand the order.
    3. the order must be consistent with organizational goals.
    4. the order must not violate an individual's personal beliefs.
- <strong>Mary Parker Follet</strong>
  - Political Scientist from Harvard
  - Found a way to use the tenets of the human relations movement to solve some of the problem with the scientific management framework.
  - Argued that there are several ways to resolve conflict:
    - Dominance - One party dictates the terms of the arrangement.
    - Compromise - Neither side gets exactly everything it wants, and the best each side can do is obtain a result that each can agree to.
    - Integration - when each party states its preferences and attempts to reach an agreement.

### Contingency and System Management

- Firms were an <strong>open system</strong> i.e. a system that interacts with its environment.

#### Contingency School

- Proposed that there are <strong>no universal rules</strong> in management.
- "It depends"
- Joan Woodward
  - Argued that contingencies, such as technology, play a role in how much training workers should receive.

### Modern Management

- Development of managerial theories.
- Deeply rooted in knowledge accumulated throughout the years of studying management.

# CHAPTER 17 Organizational PLanning and Controlling

## Planning, Organizing, Leading, Controlling Framework (Session 7)

- Four functions of management

- What managers do:
  - 25% of the time working alone (home, airplanes, commuting)
  - 70% of the time working with others (home, airplanes, commuting)
  - Some spend up to 90% of their working time talking and working with others.

| Planning              | Organizing             | Leading            | Controlling                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| 1. Vision & Mission   | 1. Organization Design | 1. Leadership      | 1. Systems/Processes         |
| 2. Strategizing       | 2. Culture             | 2. Decision Making | 2. Strategic Human Resources |
| 3. Goals & Objectives | 3. Social Networks     | 3. Communications  |
|                       |                        | 4. Groups/Teams    |
|                       |                        | 5. Motivation      |

### <Strong>Planning</Strong>

- Involves setting objectives and determining a <strong>course of action</strong> for achieving those objectives
  - Managers be aware of environmental conditions facing their organization and
  - be able to forecast future conditions
  - It also requires managers to be good decision makers
- Steps in Planning:

  1.  Conduct environment scanning
  2.  Establish objectives - what needs to be achieved and when conditions, their competitors, and their customers.
  3.  Identify alternative courses of action for achieving objectives.
  4.  Evaluating the various alternatives for achieving objectives.
  5.  Formulate necessary steps and ensure effective implementation of plans.
  6.  Constantly evaluate the success of their plans and take corrective action when necessary

- Types of Plans
  1. Strategic Planning
     - involves analyzing competitive opportunities and threats, as well as the strengths and weakness of the organization, and then determining how to position the organization to compete effectively in their environment.
  2. Tactical Planning
     - is intermediate-range (one to three years) planning that is designed to develop relatively concrete and specific means to implement the strategic plan.
  3. Operational planning
     - Generally assumes the existence of organization-wide or sub-unit goals and objectives and specifies ways to achieve them.

### <Strong>Organizing</Strong>

- involves developing an organizational structure and allocating human resources to ensure the accomplishment of objectives.
- Involves the design of individual jobs within the organization.
- Involves deciding how best to departmentalize, or cluster, jobs into departments to coordinate effort effectively.

### <Strong>Leading</Strong>

- involves the social and informal sources of influence that you use to inspire action taken by others
- Behavioral sciences have made many contributions to understanding this function of management

### <Strong>Controlling</Strong>

- involves ensuring that performance does not deviate from standards.
- requires a clear understanding of where responsibility for deviations from standards lies.
- three steps which include:
  1. establishing performance standards
  2. comparing actual performance against standards; and
  3. taking corrective action when necessary
- Control and Evaluation: measuring performance
  - financial statements, sales reports, production results, customer satisfaction, etc.AA

## Key take-aways

- The principles of management can be distilled down to four critical functions (Planning, Organizing, Leading, and Controlling)
- The POLC framework provides useful guidance into what the ideal job of a manager should look like

## Developing Vision, Mission, and Values (Session 8)

### Vision statement

- a future-oriented declaration of the organization's purpose and aspirations
- the strategy should flow directly from the vision, since the strategy is intended to achieve the vision and thus satisfy the organization's mission.
- are relatively brief or short tag lines.

### Mission statement

- Communicates the organization's purpose of being and how it aims to serve its key stakeholders.
- Often longer than vision statements.
- Sometimes contain a summation of the firm's values.

### Value statements

- Are the beliefs of an individual or group, and in this case the organization, in which they are emotionally invested.

| Mission statement             | Vision statement         | Strategy                         | Goals & Objectives                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| "Who we are", "What we value" | "What we want to become" | "How we will achieve our vision" | "How we gauge our degree of success" |

### Creativity and Passion

- <strong>Creativity</strong> is the power or ability to invent.
- Creativity = Innovation and Progress
- <strong>Passion</strong> refers to an intense, driving, or overmastering feeling or conviction
- Four types of creativity

- Creativity tools

  - Two divergent forms of thinking necessary for creativityf

    - Programmed thinking, left-brained thinking; logical and deliberate process used to develop the vision statement.
    - Lateral thinking, changing patterns and perceptions

  - SCAMPER and the Nominal Group Technique
    - SCAMPER
      - Substitute (S), Combine (C), Adapt (A), Modify (M), Put to other use (P), Eliminate (E), Rearrange (R)
    - Nominal Group Technique
      - Method of facilitating a group of people to produce a large number of ideas in a relatively short time.

### Stakeholder analysis

- How are stakeholders affected by a firm's decisions?
- How much influence do they have over the implementation of the decisions that are made?

## Key take-aways

- Mission and vision both relate to an organization's purpose and aspirations, and are typically communicated in some form of brief written statements.
- A mission statement communicates the organization's reason for being and how it aspires to serve its key stakeholders
- The vision statement is a narrower, future-oriented declaration of the organization's purpose and aspirations
- Together, mission and vision guide strategy development, help communicate the organization's purpose to stakeholders, and inform the goals and objectives set to determine whether the strategy is on track
- There are challenges in answering who are the firm's stakeholders
- On the basis of your assessment of stakeholders, you now can be proactive in involving them in the P-O-L-C stages.

## Strategic Objectives and Levels of Strategies (Session 9)

### Strategic Management

- Reflects what a firm is doing to achieve its mission and vision, as seen by its achievement of specific goals and objectives.

  - the process by which a firm manages the formulation and implementation of its strategy
  - the coordinated means by which an organization achieves its goals and objectives
  - <strong>Strategy Formulation = Business Planning = Strategic Planning</strong>

- <Strong>The Strategy Cycle</Strong>

  - Vision and Mission â†’ Strategic Analysis â†’ Develop Objectives â†’ Create and Choose Strategies â†’ Implement strategies â†’ Measure and Evaluate performance â†’ REPEAT

- Corporate Strategy
  - What business or business should we be in?
  - How does being in one business help us compete in our other businesses?
- Business Strategy
  - How should we compete?

### Strategic Inputs

- Gather information and conduct analysis about the internal characteristics of the organization and the external market conditions
- Internal appraisal: Strengths and Weaknesses
- External apparaisal: Opportunities and Threats.

- <strong>SWOT Analysis</strong>

  - Strength (S), Weaknesses (W), Opportunities (O), Threats (T)

- <strong>BCG Matrix</strong>
  - Help companies analyze their product portfolio by categorizing them into four distinct categories based on their market shares and growth rates relative to their largest competitors. These four categories include: cash cows, dogs, question marks, and stars.
  - <strong>Question Marks</strong> - Business units that are not doing well in a high-growth market and the CEO will need to decide to invest or scrap the business
  - <strong>Dog</strong> - Business units that are doing poorly in a low-growth market and should be divested
  - <strong>Cash Cow</strong> - Business units that have high market share in a market that isn't growing. CEOs should use the money they earn to invest in the Stars.
  - <strong>Stars</strong> - Business units that have high market share in a high-growth market. They generating revenue, but the CEO should invest to keep growing market share.

### Levels of Strategic Planning

- Top Managers
  - Answers "Why?" (Strategic)
- Middle Managers
  - Answer "What?" (Tactical)
- Frontline Managers
  - Answers "How?" (Operational)

## Key take-aways

- Strategy formulation is an essential component of planning
- It bridges the orgaenization to progress from vision and mission to goals and objectives
- in terms of the P-O-L-C framework, strategy formulation is the P (Planning) and strategy implementation is realized by O-L-C
- Corporate strategy helps to answer questions about which businesses to compete in, while business strategy helps to answer questions about how to compete.
- The best strategies are based on a thorough SWOT analysis - that is, a strategy that capitalizes on an organization's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats

## Strategic Analysis: Understanding a Firm's Competitive Environment (Session 10)

### Strategic Analysis

- Process that firms use to study and undestand the many different layers and aspects of their competitive environment.
- Environmental Scanning
  - Systematic and Intentional analysis of both a firm's internal state and its external competitive environment.
    - Internal factors: Strengths and Weaknesses
    - External factors: Opportunities and Threats

### SWOT Analysis for Strategic Analysis

- Strengths (Internal)
  - What a firm is good at
  - An evaluation of its capabilities and assets
- Weaknesses (Internal)
  - Things that a firm does not have the capabilities to perform well (gaps)
  - Firms will avoid trying to do things it does not have the skills or assets to succeed in.
  - Or, it will find ways to improve its weaknesses before undertaking something new.
- Opportunites (External)
  - Potential situation that a firm is equipped to take advantage of
- Threats (External)
  - Anything that would make it harder for a firm to be successful (challenging factors)

### Limitations of SWOT Analysis

- It only works as well as the person doing the analysis
- More likely to overlook key issues because it is difficult to identify or imagine everything that could be a threat to the firm

## Firm's External Environment (Session 11)

### Components of a Firm's Environment

- Internal Environment
  - Owners, Managers, Employees
- Micro Environment
  - Competetitors, Customers, Suppliers, Intermediaries
- Macro Environment
  - Government, Economy, Globalization, Laws, Environment, Sociocultural Trends, Demographics

### External Analysis Tools

- PESTEL (Political, Economic, Sociocultural, Technological, Environmental, Legal Environments)

  - To collect information about, and analyze, each environmental dimension to identify the broad range of threats and opportunities facing the organization.

- Industry Analysis
  - Map out the different relationships that the organization might have with suppliers, customers, and competitors.

PESTEL provides a good sense of the broader macro-environment while industry analysis tells about the organization's competitive environment and the key industry-level factors that seem to influence performance.

- PESTEL model for external environmental analysis
  | Factor | Examples |
  | ----------- | ----------- |
  | Political | Tax rates, tariffs, trade agreements, labor and environmental regulations |
  | Economic | Employment levels, Interest rates, Exchange rates |
  | Sociocultural | Demographic trends, consumer preferences, market diversity |
  | Technological | Internet, Smartphones, Connectivity, Automation |
  | Environmental | Resource scarcity, Recycling, energy sources |
  | Legal | Contracts, Laws, Intellectual Property Rights |

- Porter's Five Forces Model of Industry Competition

## Firm's Internal Environment (Session 12)

### Internal Analysis Tools

- Value chain

  - to take the organization apart and identify the important constituent parts or functions.

- Valuable, rare, inimitable, and organization (VRIO) framework
  - a capability, or a resource, such as a patent or great location, is likely to yield a competitive advantage to an organization when it can be shown that it is valuable, rare, difficult to imitate, and supported by the organization

Value chain might suggest internal areas of strength, VRIO helps in understanding whether those strengths will give it a competitive advantage

### Resources

- The core competencies that yield a competitive advantage are created through the unique bundling of several resources:
- Types of resources:
  - <strong>Tangible resources</strong>: assets that can be seen and quantified.
  - <strong>Intangible resources</strong>: assets that are rooted deeply in the firm's history and have accumulated over time.

### VRIO for evaluating firm resources and capabilities

- Valuable
  - Does the resource or capability generate value for the firm?
- Rare
  - Is the resource or capability rare among firms in the industry?
- Difficult to imitate
  - Would it be difficult or expensive for other firms to imitate the resource or capability?
- Organized to Capture Value
  - Is the firm effectively organized to capture the value that this resource or capability generates?

### Resources and Capabilities

- Resources
  - Things a firm has, such as cash and skilled employees, that it can use to create products or services
- Capabilities
  - A firm's skil at coordinating and leveraging resources to create value.

## Key take-aways

- Managers cannot lead their firms to success without understanding what the firm is able to do.
- A good strategy for competitive advantage capitalizes on a firm's key resources and capabilities, as identified and evaluated using the VRIO analytical tool.
- Resources and Capabilities that satisfy VRIO criteria are the key things that a firm is best at, and these should be leveraged so the firm can compete against rivals

## Competition, Strategy, and Competitive Advantage

- Competitive Advantage
  - When a firm successfully attracts more customers, earns more profit, or returns more value to its shareholders than rival firms do.
  - Generic Business-level Competitive Strategies
    1. Cost-leadership strategy
       - firm offers customers its products or service at a lower price than its rivals can.
    2. Differentiation strategy
       - firm adds value to their products and services so they can attract customers who are willing to pay a higher price
    3. Focus strategy
       - a firm still must choose one of the other strategies to organize its activities. It will strive to lower costs or add value. The difference is to concentrate its marketing and selling efforts on a smaller market than a broad cost leader or differentiator
- Strategic Groups
  - Groups of businesses that follow similar strategies in the same industry
  - Rivalry is fiercest within a strategic group
  - The actions of one firm in a group will elicit responses from other group members, who don't want to lost market share in the industry.
